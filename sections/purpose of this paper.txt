The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the performance of three different classification algorithms on a given dataset and compare the results obtained. Classification is a widely used machine learning technique that involves assigning a class label to a given input data sample based on certain features or characteristics. It is a supervised learning method, which means that the model is trained on a labeled dataset, where the correct class label is provided for each sample.

In this paper, we aim to test a dataset using three different classification algorithms and compare the results obtained. We will be using a variety of metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall, to assess the model's ability to correctly classify data samples and to identify any patterns or trends in the data.

The primary goal of this paper is to determine which of the three classification algorithms performs best on the given dataset, and to identify any strengths or weaknesses of each algorithm. By comparing the results obtained using the different classification algorithms, we hope to gain a better understanding of the suitability of each algorithm for the specific dataset and research objectives of the project. Additionally, we hope to provide insights and recommendations for future research in the field of classification.
